This means that anyone can see how the source code works and can change it if they want to make it work differently. There are different kinds of open source licences that grant permission to use open source software in different ways. These range from fully open, to fairly restrictive. \n",

If a library doesn't exist, it is easy to create. Then the next person doesn't need to re-create that wheel.\n",
