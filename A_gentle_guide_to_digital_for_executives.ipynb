Daniel Kornstein, a practicing attorney, looks at the legal issues and aspects of Shakespeare?s plays and finds fascinating parallels with many legal and social questions of the present day. The Elizabethan age was as litigious as our own, and Shakespeare was very familiar with the language and procedures of the courts. Kill All the Lawyers? examines the ways in which Shakespeare used the law for dramatic effect and incorporated the passion for justice into his great tragedies and comedies and considers the modern legal relevance of his work. ø This is a ground-breaking study in the field of literature and the law, ambitious and suggestive of the value of both our literary and our legal inheritance.',\n",

The authors propose seven learning themes to help young white children resist messages of racism and build identity and skills for thriving in a multicultural country and world. The text includes strategies, resources, and classroom examples for implementing the learning themes in early childhood settings. Taking multicultural education to a new level, this practical guide places the development of white children\\'s racial identity in the context of the historical construction of \"whiteness\" and racism in America, and suggests strategies for nurturing a new white identity as the starting place for anti-bias/multicultural work with children. It includes activities for families and staff, reflection questions, a review of white anti-racism activists, lists of suggested children\\'s books, and organizational and website resources.',\n",

Wright explores both the meaning and the results of worship. Part 1, \"The God Who is Worthy of Praise,\" focuses on God and on what worshiping God actually means. Part 2, \"Reflecting God\\'s Image in the World,\" addresses a range of church-related issues that arise from the activity of worship. Based firmly on sensitive and creative readings of the biblical text, For All God\\'s Worth is an inspiring call for renewal in the worship and witness of today\\'s church.',\n",

From coast to coast, Native Americans had created enduring cultures, and the subsequent European invasion remade much of the existing land and culture. In New Worlds for All, Colin Calloway explores the unique and vibrant new cultures that Indians and Europeans forged together in early America. The journey toward this hybrid society kept Europeans' and Indians' lives tightly entwined: living, working, worshiping, traveling, and trading together—as well as fearing, avoiding, despising, and killing one another. In the West, settlers lived in Indian towns, eating Indian food. In Mohawk Valley, New York, Europeans tattooed their faces; Indians drank tea. And, a unique American identity emerged.\",\n",
