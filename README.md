# A gentle guide to digital for executives
Welcome to an introduction to digital for executives. The idea behind this notebook is that by putting some basic programming into practice, you can learn a lot about how modern applications work and consequently, how the world and your business work.

## Technology & digital are ubiquitous
It's easy to see what technology does. It's around you and you use it hundreds of times each day. You drive your car, open your phone, check your texts and emails, take photographs, share them on social media, do your banking and video-call your family.

Modern applications do all of this and more. They track and share data, conduct millions of mathematical operations in seconds and, more recently, can recognized patters in text, data and images - often better than people can.

Regardless of your business, it is enabled and empowered through technology and digital. Put another way, digital is no longer a separate thing - it is part of our everyday world. If you don't understand digital, you don't understand how the world works, what challenges will arise or what possible solutions might exist.

This guide will help. We will start with how applications work.
